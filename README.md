# Polyform-Beta
A version repository for beta releases of M2

This is a control repository meant for storing and publishing all beta builds of MultiMino 2: Polyform only,
meaning that even small bug fixes that are not that significative will be publish here, despite lacking on
new content. On the other hand, stable builds of the game will be release on itch.io

Multimino doesn't require instalation, just download the latest 

No source code will be available here and probably will never be, so please avoid asking why there isn't any.


If you came from somewhere else, please consider joining the Discord server to be informed of any changes!
